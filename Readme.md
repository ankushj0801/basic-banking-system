# Basic Banking System
This is a Basic Banking System Website which I have successfully completed under my one month internship with The Sparks Foundation as an web development intern. It's a prominent platform to get started with projects and enhance the required skills. Website Link: https://internship.thesparksfoundation.info/ 

This is a simple interfance design which includes the home page, customer page,about TSF page. In Transaction page, the customers can send money by clicking on 'SEND MONEY' button and have to enter Recipient's and Receiver's mail to send money. All Transaction Details can be seen through 'SEE ALL TRANSACTIONS' button.
